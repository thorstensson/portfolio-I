### OLD portfolio
Everyone makes mistakes where things break. The code in this particular repo does not reflect where I am in Vue or in my coding in general, but some years ago, I was still doing Vue 2. Unfortunately, this code drives my 'current' portfolio...

:sunny: But good news: I'm working on a new portfolio to come on a new domain. First off is a new landing page, coming the second week of February 2025 (Audio, 3D, Vue 3.5+).

:zap: For now, I recommend navigating across to my [audio player]https://github.com/thorstensson/audio-player-vue-ts instead.

This is **ARCHIVED**.
